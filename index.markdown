I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in the EECS department at MIT, where
I'll be advised by Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Yael Tauman
Kalai. I'm interested in theoretical computer science, especially
algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and cryptography.

Previously, I was an undergrad at MIT; then, I was very lucky to be
advised by Bill Kuszmaul and Virginia Williams. I also spent a summer
at the Duluth REU run by Joe Gallian and Colin Defant.

You can reach me at zoexi at mit dot edu.
