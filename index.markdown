I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the EECS department at MIT, where
I'm fortunate to be advised by Yael Tauman Kalai and Ryan
Williams. Before this, I was an undergrad at MIT; then, I was
extremely lucky to be advised by Bill Kuszmaul and Virginia
Vassilevska Williams. I also spent a summer at the Duluth REU run by
Joe Gallian and Colin Defant.

I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science. I've done
research in graph algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and data
structures. Lately I've become excited about applying concepts from
complexity theory and cryptography towards understanding AI safety.
