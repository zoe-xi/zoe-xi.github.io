I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in the EECS department at MIT, where  
I'll be advised by Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Yael Tauman  
Kalai. I'm interested in theoretical computer science, especially  
algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and cryptography.  

Previously, I was an undergrad at MIT; then, I was very lucky to be  
advised by Bill Kuszmaul and Virginia Williams.
