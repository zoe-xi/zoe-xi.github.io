# Zoe Xi

I’m an incoming PhD student in the EECS department at MIT, where I’ll
be advised by Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Yael Tauman Kalai. I’m
interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithms,
fine-grained complexity, and cryptography.

Previously, I was an undergrad also at MIT; then, I was very lucky to be
advised by Bill Kuszmaul and Virginia Williams.
